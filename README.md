# DREAM-Twitter-Data-Mining-101.1-tutorial

In 2018, I was tasked with giving a tutorial to MNSU students on how to mine twitter data to later use in a ML model.


For this tutorial, we will require these files which are attached. Download all and put them in a zip folder which will make it easier to input and output files.

There are three pre-requisites to this tutorial.

One pre-requisite to this tutorial is Basic Python meaning you must have the basic knowledge of how to define function and know how it works, basic data structures such as lists and dictionaries.

The other is that you must have all the four keys provided by twitter once you login as a developer. I have attached a link on how-to do that on the powerpoint slide here in case you have not.

The last one is that you need to have Jupiter Notebook installed. We will do simple data mining for now. Later, if time permits, towards the end of the semester, we might do a part 2 on Data Cleaning and Twitter Sentimental Analysis.
